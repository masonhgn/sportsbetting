get each player's info by searching with their id, and then save some info from that into each Player object
according to their position, we shall assign different weights to their offensive and defensive ratings

Perhaps we should make a little class called DataLoader which fetches all of the data that we need to load up the Player classes.
This should implement the stuff in the data_collection and research ipynb files. Specifically, we need to:

1. fetch all games for a particular season into a list 
2. fetch boxscore of every game in that list

3. get stats of each participating player in all games
4. save those stats for each individual player's Player class object
